I recently eliminated every vice from my life. Smoking, drinking, masturbating, video games, sugar and over-eating are gone for good. I would never see myself doing those things again, because by eliminating them I found something far too precious to discard. I found my virtue.

## About gluttony and sloth

Over the 7 deadly sins, gluttony and sloth are by far the two most abused ones. I see them everywhere, when I go to the mall, when I go to the restaurant and when I walk on the street. I like to call them “MacDo-TikTok” because these two companies perfectly embody the two sins. Over the past two decades we have built a society of hungry and lazy people. We are living the heyday of obesity and phone addiction.

Removing these two sins from my life was easier than what I expected. I encourage anybody who is experience a life transformation journey to do the same. To get rid of gluttony I started intermittent fasting. I was a bit hard to eat only one meal per day at first, but the feeling of profound energy I got out of it was so intense that I decided to do it until I would be slim again (I have a bit of fat around the belly like so many others). To get rid of sloth the first thing I did was getting rid of TikTok and Youtube on my phone. The results were immediate. I also decided to go to the gym everyday or so. With the extra time these decisions got me I could read more, and focus more on my projects. I am now able to spot a sin as it comes to me and prevent it.

## Being virtuous

The conclusion of this adventure is that nothing beats virtue. It is the uppermost quality in life. Being virtuous means being able to take control of your life. Nothing stops me, my projects are doing great and my life is on track for success. I feel there is a higher order law that enhances the life of the virtuous. Call it the law of attraction or something else, but it must exist in some way.

One thing is for sure, now that I have found it I will not let it go. I do not intend to be proselytising about it, simply to enjoy it for myself.

Let me know if you too are experiencing something similar. I would love to hear your story.
