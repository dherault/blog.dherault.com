I recently went on a personal journey of growth and discipline. Here is my story.

## Sins and vice

I used to smoke and vape, eat too much - I had what I called a “fat belly”, not exercise and overall tend to sin every single day. Not in the religious sense but in the everyday, insidious and relentless sense. This is hard to write because it was a time when I was underachieving and not productive enough. I did not know where to start to get my life straight, so I went radical.

## Radical changes

To change everything overnight is no small feat. But it is what I did. I quit smoking and vaping without warning, all in one go. During the same period, I started intermittent fasting by eating only one meal a day. I decided I would not eat sugar anymore (neither processed nor fruits!). And I started going to the gym every single day. There was no incremental change to this, it all happened in a radical way. Had I tried to quit smoking incrementally, I would have failed for sure, because bad habits come back easily. The key here was to combine several drastic changes at once, to leverage the pain of habit change by bundling it during a single time frame. So yes, going radical allowed me to succeed, tremendously.

## Results

It has been two months since I started this. I haven’t touched a cigaret or a vaping pod for this entire time. I lost 14 kilos thanks to fasting and can do cardio like never before. Plus eating one meal a day made me richer by not paying for lunch anymore. I starting being more productive at my job. Radical changes offer radical results, sometimes unexpected. Of course I craved a cigarette or a meal at the beginning of my journey, but I learn that the most important things in life take time, and that quick pleasure is to be banned to achieve more. I strongly encourage you to be radical too, by saying no to what brings you down, bundle your efforts and discover that inner discipline that not only is the key to success, but also to a deeper happiness.
